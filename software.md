## ExactCoxPBD

The [`ExactCoxPBD`](https://github.com/Stat-Y/ExactCoxPBD) R package enables fitting the Cox model by optimizing the exact partial likelihood, as proposed in *"An Accurate Computational Approach for Partial Likelihood Using Poisson-Binomial Distributions"* (Cho et al., 2025+) in *Computational Statistics & Data Analysis*. [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18715) This method is especially useful for data with heavy ties or high covariate variation, providing improved accuracy in Cox model estimation.
