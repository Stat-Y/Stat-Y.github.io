## Welcome to Youngjin Cho's Homepage

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Virginia Tech, advised by Dr. Pang Du, with Dr. Yili Hong as my co-advisor. My research interests include:

- **Smoothing Splines:** I conduct research on various smoothing spline ANOVA models, concentrating on 1) developing models for survival data and 2) exploring statistical inference using functional Bahadur representation.
- **Functional Data Analysis:** I take a more application-driven approach, applying functional data analysis to various types of data. One key area is the analysis of battery degradation data, which involves longitudinal functional data with a heterogeneous domain.  
- **Survival Analysis:** I focus on the accurate computation of partial likelihood, including computational, methodological, and theoretical development, with a particular emphasis on applications involving heavily tied data. 
- **High-Dimensional Statistics:** I work on variable selection for multiple responses.
- **Collaborative Research:** I am also involved in a collaborative project in social science.

  To contact me, the best way is to email [youngjin@vt.edu](mailto:youngjin@vt.edu). For more details about me, see my [CV](link-to-your-CV).
