## Welcome to Youngjin Cho's Homepage

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Virginia Tech and have accepted an offer to join the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as a tenure-track assistant professor, starting in January 2026. My research interests include:

- **Smoothing Splines**: I conduct research on smoothing spline ANOVA models, specifically concentrating on (1) developing models for survival data and (2) exploring statistical inference, including effect-wise hypothesis testing.
- **Functional Data Analysis**: I take an application-driven approach to functional datasets. A key focus is battery discharge curve data, representing longitudinal functional data with a heterogeneous domain.
- **Survival Analysis**: I focus on the accurate computation of partial likelihood, including computational, methodological, and theoretical development, with a particular emphasis on its application to heavily tied data.
- **High-Dimensional Statistics**: I work on variable selection for datasets with multivariate responses.
- **Collaborative Research**: I am also involved in collaborative projects in social science.  

To contact me, the best way is to email [youngjin@vt.edu](mailto:youngjin@vt.edu). For more details, see my [Curriculum Vitae](CV_Youngjin_Cho.pdf). You can also visit my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=E2Y3PdEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
